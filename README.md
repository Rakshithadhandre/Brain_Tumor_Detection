# Brain_Tumor_Detection_Using Deep Learning(CNN)

In our Brain Tumor Detection system, we've integrated a user-friendly web application along with a powerful CNN model. This combination enables a straightforward process where users can upload MRI scans of the brain and select 'Submit.' Upon doing so, our system promptly analyzes the scan and predicts the immediate presence of a brain tumor. However, it's crucial to keep in mind that our system is designed as a complementary tool for healthcare professionals and should not replace their expertise. While we aim for high accuracy, there may be certain limitations, so it's always advisable to consult with medical experts for a conclusive diagnosis. We highly value your feedback in our continuous efforts to enhance the system's performance and remain dedicated to preserving your privacy while adhering to all relevant legal regulations.
